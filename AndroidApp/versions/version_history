v1.1
	Add new permission code for Android 6. Should not interfere with other versions of Android.

v1.2	
	Attempted fix of Android 6 permission code.

v1.3
	Made menu bar smaller and removed Settings from there.
	Added app-version to userAgent string from webview.
	Added automatic "imei" get through app. Uses ANDROID_ID instead (it's not imei, but it requires no special permissions). 
	Added way to see which version of the app we are using (so long as it's done manually in Android studio), by looking at phone settings -> Apps -> Eyra X.X.

v1.4
	Fixed issue with Stop button taking very long to respond while still being enabled on lower processing power phones (now takes much less).
