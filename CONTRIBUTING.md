### Contributor License Agreements

Before we can use your code, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other things â€” for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign the CLA until after you've submitted your pull request, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement:

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual).

* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and submit it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.
